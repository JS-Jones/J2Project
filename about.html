        <h2>Joshua Jones</h2>
        <div class="bio">
            <p> In my academic and professional experience, I've built this duality between <b>Business</b> and 
                <b>Cognitive Sciences</b>, both anchored in <b>Computer Science</b>. Aside from my focus in MedTech, 
                I hope to expand my impact to a <b>Global Setting</b> and bring a new wave of <b>Innovation</b>.
                <br><br>
                <h4>In the next 10 years (hopefully by 2035) I believe that ...</h4>

                <ul> • MedTech innovations will facilitate <b>real-time health monitoring</b> and <b>early detection</b> of diseases through wearable devices and biosensors.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ex) My Fitbit will not only record my 10k steps but also let me know if I need a doctor checkup
                </ul>
                <ul> • Advancements in <b>telemedicine and remote healthcare technologies</b> will make medical services more <b>accessible</b>, especially in underserved regions.</ul>
                <ul> • <b>Neuroprosthetics or Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI)</b> will better integrate with the human nervous system, thereby improving the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. 
                    This will be achieved through several key developments: 
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- <b>Enhanced Signal Processing:</b> Advances in machine learning will improve the interpretation of signals.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- <b>New Biocompatible Materials</b> will reduce the risk of rejection and increase the longevity of implants.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- <b>User-Centric Design:</b> creation of devices that are tailored to individual needs.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- <b>Integration</b> with technology like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) for rehabilitation processes.
                    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- <b>Shift</b> of BCI Technology from R&D to Commercial applications.
                </ul>
